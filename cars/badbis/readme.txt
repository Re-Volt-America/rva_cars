"is that the flat slug?" -Elven

Aptly called the "Phat Slug" of the amateur class, this monster truck is terribly optimized for any kind of competitive racing, even at Toy level. Despite this, the Bad Bison has a major cult following among hobbyists for it's sheer vintage value. You may not be the fastest or agile thing on the track, but you sure are the most expensive.

This car was inspired by the Tamiya Mad Bull monster truck/buggy thing from the 80s.
