Car information
================================================================
Car name : Sideswipe
Car Type : Remodel
Top speed : 44mph / 71kph
Rating/Class : 4 (pro) (actually "super-pro")
Installed folder : ...\cars\sideswipe
Description : Remodel of Photon Falcon which itself is a
Repaint/reparam of TMaM's Inferno? which in turn is also a
Repaint/reparam of Bolink by RiffRaff which in turn is also a
car

Saffron: "A little slidy but also raily"
URV: "wat :hausderp:"
Saffron: "It'll make more sense when you drive it"

For those of you who haven't driven Photon Falcon, go search it up and take it
for a spin. Its visage and handling cannot be described by mere, mortal, words.

actually they can it looks like it took five minutes in mspaint to skin and the
params are basically a drifter on steroids

The params for *this* car are mostly from Photon Falcon, with some polishing by
Saffron to make it vaguely competitive in the new "Super-Pro" class.

Competitive or not, it's still quite interesting to drive.

I've also done a near-complete remodel of the body, ripping it down to its basic
splines and rebuilding it to actually look decent.
Also gave it a skin befitting of its parameters.
