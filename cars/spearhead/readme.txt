Going fast and going sideways is what this car is all about. Inspired by the performance of full sized rally cars, Spearhead has all the acceleration and maneuverability you could want from an off road racer of this size.

Fun fact: this car was inspired by Patriot Blackfoot rally car from Motorstorm Pacific Rift, my favorite racing game of all time
