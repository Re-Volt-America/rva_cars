Car information
__________________________________________________________________________
Car name		: Phantera ART
Car Type		: Remodel
Top speed	: 45 Mph
Rating/Class	: Super-Pro
Installed folder	: ...\cars\phanteraart
Description	: This is my rendition of XJ220 TWR, thought Thames GT - TTdriver
		  could use better modifications. Being it still 4WD but not AWD,
		  it's lighter, more powerful, and looking more sleek obviously.
		  What i'm more glad is to make many race themed liveries, ofc
		  especially the Silk Cut bootleg "Volt Age".

		  I use FH4 engine sound, closest sound if its rc car instead.
		  Main nemesis = Irakso Devil & Devyaty
		  Lesser nemesis = X-Matix 133, Gugnir, & Origin
