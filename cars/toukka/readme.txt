Toukka 4x4 by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hi! this is my entry for the 2023 rvw birthday competition. toukka 4x4's body and movement tries to resemble a caterpillar. it moves slowly but once it gains momentum it is hard to stop. steering through narrow sections can be difficult but rewarding. for the most part, pickups are also its big weakness because of weight distribution. toukka has 3 base skins based on real life vurms. the name is not a mistake btw! its a joke because of how only 4 of the wheels actually exist :D enjoy the sound of the vurm and have fun!
