Tin Lizzie by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hey! tin lizzie is of course based on nothing else than the legendary ford model t, also nicknamed "tin lizzie". it is a very fragile car, standing at mere 0.7kg it is nothing but a light electric engine under a cheap manufactured toy-volt chassis. the engine is located at the back, so the car is rwd like its real life counterpart. due to its weight it is a good runner, but it also has lower grip to compensate because of the use of bad quality tires during production (atleast they give you a spare tire at the back). you would expect it to be in rookie class, but no, surprise! it is quite capable in amateur. tin lizzie also features a custom horn, i think you will enjoy that! this is very probably my last creation for atleast a week due to irl time constraints, but i will try to work on new content as much as i can. have fun and enjoy!
