Description             : Well, here's a fine car. The Spectre is
a project car. We don't know from what country it comes, but does
that really matter if you look at that beautiful body and the 
GT40-like skin? We don't think so. The handling is cool and the
speed is just right. Tuff AI as always will give you a good challenge.
