AMCO TC by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

Hi! this month i bring you a new truck to the current roster. AMCO TC was developed as a project by the AMCO-TEC Racing team which also organized yearly events on the various AMCO tracks such as Bitume, TT, Driftume or the long forgotten AMCO Ring. AMCO TC was meant to expand the number of categories at the time, which consisted of mostly regular cars. AMCO-TEC thought that truck races would bring more viewers to the races. And they were right. The AMCO TC category soon became one of the most watched on the weekends, sometimes even surpassing the classic Toyeca category. 
AMCO TC makes use of a washing machine engine, its loud but reliable, it reaches the topspeed pretty fast. Turning radius is decent but the selling point of the truck is its weight. At 3.7kg it is by far the heaviest out there. What are you waiting for? Give AMCO TC a try! :>
