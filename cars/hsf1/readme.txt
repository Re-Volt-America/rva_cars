HSF-1 by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

Horizontal Slosh Force 1, codename HSF-1, was a secret project led by a team of ingenious ToyVolt engineers who wanted to challenge the norm of RC cars produced at the time. They used a combination of various techniques that were never tried before to put the car together. Because of this the development of the suspension was heavily neglected and the car struggles upon landings. On the other hand, the revolutionary techniques led the team to success as HSF-1 was able to show its strenghts in speed and aerodynamics. One of said techniques is for example the use of two small spoilers that are detached from one another instead of the usual spoiler RC cars have. What is more the spoilers also act as sensors that move in a certain way that improves aero in some way. Give HSF-1 a spin and have fun!
