Yognac by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hi! or should i say yog yog? meet yognac. the car has high downforce and com located more in front. it is very agile, turns fast and it is quite a runner. porpoising is an issue though, sometimes the air gets under the car too much and on landings it can struggle. have fun!
