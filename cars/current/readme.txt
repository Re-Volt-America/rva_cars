Current by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hey there! ever wanted to drive like an alternating current? well now you can. current is capable of driving upside down with no issues, but also driving in reverse the same way as normal. it is 4 wheel steering. so it comes as no surprise that fast recovery is its main selling point. you could also look at current as the true rotor in semi-pros because it is up par with cars as adeon, zipper or bhv1. it is powered by an electrical motor turbo008X which is capable of the top speed of 38mph but it comes with a weight that brings the cars total up to 2.9kg, thats a lot. thats about it, thanks, have fun and enjoy!
