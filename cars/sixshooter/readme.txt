Six Shooter by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

I was bored today so I made me some coffee and this came out of it. Inspired by a funny chatgpt response that said R8 is in the game and ranked it at 25th place based on stock car performance from best to worst. Thats also why the car looks loosely like a budget R8 Revolver. It also has a custom engine sound that shoots all the "bullets" at once without reloading, hinting at the name. 
When it comes to how the car drives, it is pretty straightforward, nothing special.. Well, except the usage of 4-wheel steering, which is veeery subtle because of how unresponsive and dull the steering is. Suspension is great, car is light and agile when it comes to combat/fakes/bombs. After suffering a zap the car rolls a bit, but not much. The battery can take a bit to get used to and it is the biggest downside of pickup-play. I have also bundled in a brown "beta" skin. Hope you enjoy!
