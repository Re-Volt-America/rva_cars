Roadkill by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hey, roadkill takes inspiration from the tc cars. the paintjob is an overkill but i think it works well. car itself is exceptionally challenging to drive; at low speeds its easy to oversteer and at high speeds it acts as a railer. the challenge is to keep it at high speeds for as long as you can while fighting with pickups. it has a very good top speed for semi pro class. have fun!
