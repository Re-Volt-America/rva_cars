Downforce by Zeino (Tryxn on RVZ)

hi! downforce is an amateur car that is set to break havoc in the class. it is really fast and the accel is not the worst either, but it is light, understeery and most of all, it tends to flip over when accelerating - the center of mass is something toy-volt didnt take much into account when making this car. albeit these shortcomings it makes up for it for the most part, you can play around them and make the most of the car. since it is 4wd you might expect the steering to be straight forward but the amount of power distributed to the front is small compared to the back so it is heavily track dependant too. i would compare it to patriot. i hope you enjoy!
