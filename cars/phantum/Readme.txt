For the most part, this is an original Racing Truck, with models and textures made by me. This is my second ever custom car. The design however was heavily inspired by the 1995 Traxxas Spirit 1/10 scale truck (hence the name). So, theres your history lesson for the day! But anyways, enjoy this truck, be free to modify or use the params and models and textures to your own needs, but if you do re-release it on RV zone, please be sure to credit the owner! (AKA yours truly)

PS: happy post Halloween to anyone reading this!
