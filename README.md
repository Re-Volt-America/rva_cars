RVA Car Pack
===
Part of [Re-Volt America's](https://github.com/Re-Volt-America/rva_pack) base repository.
The base repository includes this repository as a sub-module.

## Tasks
The rva_cars repository contains the following rake tasks:
  - `:clean`: Removes all unnecessary files from cars/, such as paintkits, extra folders, etc. Use it before pushing to this repo!
  - `:carboxes`: Takes all car boxes from cars/ and organises them into carboxes/. We use these for the website.

## Note
If you already have installed [Re-Volt I/O's](https://re-volt.io/downloads/packs) Main Car Pack (v23.0923),
then you can download a reduced version of our pack which only includes the extra requiered cars
